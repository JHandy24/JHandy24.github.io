# My projects  :raised_hands:
Below are two of my favorite projects that I have done. Click on the link to see the repo for the projects.

### Project: Object-Oriented Cartoon :eyes:
In this project, I created two instances of a cartoon and allow the user to drag and change the color of the cartoon's. The user can drag the body and it will separate from the head, or they can drag the head and it will bring the body along with it regardless of where the body has been dragged to. There is also a button panel with four different color options below the cartoon's. The user can click on a color button and then click on a body part and the color will change. I am proud of this project because it is perhaps the most complex object-oriented program I have done yet.

### Project: Clickable Worm :eyes:
In this project, I created a worm object and allow the user to change the color of the body of the worm by clicking the body. This project is special to me because it was the first time I ever used action events in my code. Action events are a crucial part of object oriented design in Java and I was very excited to use this tool.
